After a customer purchases a product from Olist Store, a seller gets notified to fulfil that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
Here are some ideas of the kinds of analyses you might conduct for Olist Store:
1.	Feedback Sentiment Analysis: Evaluate the polarity of the tweets as customer feedback positive, negative or neutral.
2.	Clustering: Some customers did not write a review. But for those that did, why are they happy or mad? 
3.	Sales Prediction: With purchase date information you will be able to predict future sales. 
4.	Delivery Performance: Be able to work through delivery performance and find ways to optimise delivery times.
